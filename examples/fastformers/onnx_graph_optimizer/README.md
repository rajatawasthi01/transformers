# Transformer Model Optimization Tool

This model optimization tool is modified from [the original model optimization tool](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/onnxruntime/python/tools/transformers) from onnxruntime for the purpose of this project. Therefore, it doesn't contain full general functionality as the original optimization tool. This is meant to be used via `run_superglue.py` rather than used as a stand-alone tool. 

To use the stand-alone model optimization tool, please use the [onnxruntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/master/onnxruntime/python/tools/transformers) version.
